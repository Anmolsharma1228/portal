        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The Alpha Move Strategy is a carefully crafted short-term investment
          approach designed for individuals who aim to maximize returns within a
          defined period of 6 to 12 months. Unlike traditional long-term
          strategies that rely on holding investments for years, Alpha Move
          focuses on short-duration opportunities in the market where momentum,
          trend shifts, and growth catalysts align to deliver potential
          outperformance, or what we call alpha.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          In today’s fast-paced financial markets, short-term opportunities
          often arise due to changing economic conditions, quarterly earnings,
          sectoral trends, or government policy shifts. The Alpha Move Strategy
          leverages these catalysts to create a disciplined, research-backed
          investment plan that minimizes risks while targeting superior gains.
